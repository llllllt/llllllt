I had heard some members of a British forum I frequent raving about the taste of a soda called Irn Bru.  I decided to get a can and find out what it tasted like for myself.\\nIt was...interesting.  The soda was amber in flavor, and very sweet.  I'm tempted to say it had a bit of a fruity tinge to it, but I couldn't specify which fruit.  A very hard to describe taste, to say the least.  The sweetness, however, made me decide that it really wasn't worth the $1.79 I spent on one can.\\nAnyone else tried Irn Bru?\"},\n",
